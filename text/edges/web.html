These links were generated using social network analysis to calculate the degree of similarity between two posts in respect of the number of approaches (up to 2), and the number of outlooks on themes (up to 2), the two share. The width of the edge between the posts' nodes is proportional to the total number of common respects (between 1 and 4)--posts with no links had no common respects. Similarity between posts is not indicated by proximity in the the graph but by the width of the edge between them; posts linked by wider edges are more similar than posts whose links are narrower. </body>
