<p>Habitat describes the space where a species is found, and in ecology was traditionally thought of as a set of external environmental factors that an organism would seek out to meet their needs in an energy efficient manner. More and more, we have seen that species can also alter the environment to meet their needs by controlling the availability of resources, thus creating habitat for themselves and other organisms.
