<strong>Limits.</strong> Do our  human capacities to alter our environment to meet our standards of habitability mean we are capable of transcending natural limits on our way of life? Or, is our habitation subject to limitations expressed by the proposal that there are “planetary boundaries?” Alternatively, are there <em>moral</em> limits which demand fair access to habitability to all people and even other species?<br />
        <p><em>Alternative outlooks</em>:
        <p style="margin-left:40px;text-indent:-20px;"><strong>Lp:</strong> post emphasizes limitations on habitation set by <em>physical</em> factors (e.g. planetary boundaries) (<em>solid line</em>)</p>
        <p style="margin-left:40px;text-indent:-20px;"><strong>Lm:</strong> post emphasizes limitations on habitation set by <em>moral</em> factors (e.g. justice) (<em>broken line</em>)</p>
