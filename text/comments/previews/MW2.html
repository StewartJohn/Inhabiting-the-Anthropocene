<p>In my earlier post I raised the question of how equity issues fit with the concept of habitability in the Anthropocene. This topic perhaps leads us into the muck of the impacts humans cause when we claim dominion over the spaces we inhabit. I think we need to take a step back and institute our own "cultural rules," as Ingo noted, simply in order to manage ourselves, whatever our impact on other species or the rest of nature may be.
