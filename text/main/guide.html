<p>The goal of this site is to help you choose a path through our posts. Before suggesting ways to choose which post to start with, and which ones to read after that, let us give you an overview of how the site works.</p>
<h3>Operating the Site</h3>
<p>This site is designed to be navigated with the graphs that appear to the left. Each of the four graphs offers a different "view" of the set of posts, by representing different sorts of relationships among them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use the "Select a View" dropdown menu to the left to  activate the corresponding graph.</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>If the graph does not render properly click "<strong>Redraw Graph</strong>." </li>
    <li>You can <strong>rearrange the nodes</strong> by dragging them with the mouse.</li>
    <li> An <strong>explanation of the view will appear in the right of the screen</strong>. This will be replaced by the posts (and other content), but you can bring it back by <strong>clicking on the name of the view</strong> in the bar below the graph[ or use the Contents tab in the top menu].</li>
    <li>A <em>Key</em> to the view will appear below the graph to the left, and will remain until you choose another view.</li>
    <li>Once in a view you can click the "Contents" tab in the top menu to see a listing of the posts represented in the graph[ and explanations of other views].</li>
  </ul>
  <li>In all views, the <strong>circles represent posts</strong>--color-coded to the author and labeled with his or her initials.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hover</strong> the mouse over a post node to <strong>see its title</strong>, and a bio of the author in the <em>Comments</em> section below the graph. </li>
    <li><strong>Click</strong> on a post node to <strong>select</strong> it.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Post appears at the right of the screen</strong>.</li>
      <li>Author's <strong>bio stays in the Comments</strong> until the mouse hovers elsewhere.</li>
      <li>The <strong>selected node</strong> will have a <strong>yellow border</strong> when the mouse moves away.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>In <strong>Approaches and Themes views</strong> there are <strong>additional nodes</strong>--colored squares for Approaches, gray polygons for Themes.
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>Approach colors determine the colors for the authors</strong>--see the <strong>legend in the <em>Comments</em></strong> section. (It shows unless other information is put there.)</li>
      <li><strong>Hover and click</strong> on these nodes to <strong>see explanations</strong>--in the <em>Comments</em>, and at the right of the screen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In most views, <strong>clicking a node will zoom the graph</strong> to a closer look at that node and the others it links to.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Click in the white space</strong> around the graph to <strong>zoom back out</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Click on the name of the view</strong> below the graph to see the <strong>explanation of the view</strong> at the right of the screen.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Edges</strong> (lines between nodes) indicate a <strong>relationship</strong> between them--depending on the current view.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hover/click </strong>to see a brief <strong>explanation</strong> on the graph, and more detail in the <em>Comments</em> section.</li>
    <li>In <strong>Author-Supplied Pairings View</strong> broken/faint edges indicate whether an author identified the linked posts as similar or different. These <strong>can be toggled off and on with buttons</strong> in the lower right corner of the graph.
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Finding your way among the posts</h3>
<p>With one exception the graphs do not present determined sequences of posts. They offer multiple paths; the function of the site is to interpret options, in order to inform your choice of what post to read next.
<ul>
  <li>Only the <strong>Chronological View presents a determined sequence</strong> of posts: they are presented in the <strong>order they appeared on the original blog</strong>. There is no particular order regarding the content--they were posted as fit the authors' schedules.</li>
  <li>You can certainly <strong>read posts in an arbitrary order</strong>. Select any view, and simply click.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>You can use the <strong>list of posts available from the Contents tab</strong> in the top menu to see titles to help you choose.</li>
    <li>Or, in any but the Chronological View you can <strong>click "Random Post"</strong> to have the site choose for you.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The <strong>Approaches and Themes Views</strong> represent the <strong>conceptual structure of the relationships among the posts</strong>. You can use them to navigate in order to explore different relationships.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Approaches View</strong> shows how posts are linked by <strong>common intellectual approaches</strong> (refer to the <em>Key</em> and hover on approach nodes to see <em>Comments</em>)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>After reading a post you can <strong>read another that takes the same approach</strong>.</li>
      <li> Follow the edge to the <strong>approach node</strong> you are interested in and <strong>click to show other posts related in this way</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The <strong>Themes View</strong> shows how posts are linked by <strong>common themes</strong> (refer to the <em>Key</em> and hover on approach nodes to see <em>Comments</em>)
      <ul>
        <li>After reading a post you can <strong>read another that addresses the same theme</strong>.</li>
        <li> Follow the edge to the <strong>theme node </strong>you are interested in  and <strong>click to show other posts related in this way</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NOTE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STYLE OF THE EDGES</strong>.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Posts are classed as taking <strong>one of two outlooks on the given theme</strong>.</li>
        <li>The <strong>outlooks are explained</strong> in the pages for the Themes View, and for each theme node--and summarized in the Comments when you hover on and edge.</li>
        <li><strong>Note the style of the edge that links to the theme</strong> you are interesed in--either solid or broken.</li>
        <li>After you click on that theme, <strong>follow the same edge style to read posts that have the same outlook</strong>, and the <strong>other edge style to read posts that have the contrasting outlook</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>The Author-Supplied Pairings View shows suggests from the authors for direct post-to-post connections.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For each of their posts the authors suggested two by other authors--one that is broadly similar, one that is broadly different.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The edge colors indicate who suggested the pairing; the line style indicates his or her suggestion that the linked posts are similar (broken) or different (faint).</li>
      <li>(A solid edge indicates that the linked posts are by the same author.)</li>
      <li>The authors supplied explanations of these pairings, which refer to the approaches, themes and outlooks, which appear in the Comment area when an edge is hovered or clicked.</li>
      <li>They made some suggestions about the order in which posts should be read--indicated with arrows.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>To make use of the authors' suggestions</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Select a starting post--arbitrarily or click Random Post below the graph.</li>
      <li>When you have read the post, hover over its edges to see suggestions from its author or other authors about companion posts.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
</ul>
