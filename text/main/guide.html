<p>The goal of this site is for you to read our posts. Before suggesting ways to choose which post to start with, and which ones to read after that, let us give you an overview of how the site operates.</p>
<p>This site is designed to be navigated with the graphs that appear to the left. Each of the four graphs offers a different "view" of the set of posts, by representing different sorts of relationships among them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use the "Select a View" dropdown menu to the left to  activate the corresponding graph.</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>If the graph does not render properly click "<strong>Redraw Graph</strong>." </li>
    <li>You can <strong>rearrange the nodes</strong> by dragging them with the mouse.</li>
    <li> An <strong>explanation of the view will appear in the right of the screen</strong>. This will be replaced by the posts (and other content), but you can bring it back by <strong>clicking on the name of the view</strong> in the bar below the graph[ or use the Contents tap in the top menu].</li>
    <li>A <em>Key</em> to the view will appear below the graph to the left, and will remain until you choose another view.</li>
    <li>Once in a view you can click the "Contents" tab in the top menu to see a listing of the posts represented in the graph[ and explanations of other views].</li>
  </ul>
  <li>In all views, the <strong>circles represent posts</strong>--color-coded to the author and labeled with his or her initials.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hover</strong> the mouse over a post node to <strong>see its title</strong>, and a bio of the author in the <em>Comments</em> section below the graph. </li>
    <li><strong>Click</strong> on a post node to <strong>select</strong> it.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Post appears at the right of the screen</strong>.</li>
      <li>Author's <strong>bio stays in the Comments</strong> until the mouse hovers elsewhere.</li>
      <li>The <strong>selected node</strong> will have a <strong>yellow border</strong> when the mouse moves away.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>In <strong>Approaches and Themes views</strong> there are <strong>additional nodes</strong>--colored squares for Approaches, gray polygons for Themes.
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>Approach colors determine the colors for the authors</strong>--see the <strong>legend in the <em>Comments</em></strong> section. (It shows unless other information is put there.)</li>
      <li><strong>Hover and click</strong> on these nodes to <strong>see explanations</strong>--in the <em>Comments</em>, and at the right of the screen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In most views, <strong>clicking a node will zoom the graph</strong> to a closer look at that node and the others it links to.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Click in the white space</strong> around the graph to <strong>zoom back out</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Click on the name of the view</strong> below the graph to see the <strong>explanation of the view</strong> at the right of the screen.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Edges</strong> (lines between nodes) indicate a <strong>relationship</strong> between them--depending on the current view.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hover/click </strong>to see a brief <strong>explanation</strong> on the graph, and more detail in the <em>Comments</em> section.</li>
    <li>In <strong>Author-Supplied Pairings View</strong> broken/faint edges indicate whether an author identified the linked posts as similar or different. These <strong>can be toggled off and on with buttons</strong> in the lower right corner of the graph.
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>how to choose posts; then what you will find there--talk about comments and links</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the Approaches and Themes vie</p>
<p> You choose which graph to activate with the . When you select a view a more detailed explanation of it appears in this window, and a brief explanation appears below the graph, to the left. </p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Approaches View</strong>. This shows nodes for the posts and for the four approaches taken the authors, and edges showing which posts take which approach. This table explains how to operate this view:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <table width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="3" align="center">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col" width="10%">&nbsp;</th>
          <th scope="col" width="30%">Post Node</th>
          <th scope="col" width="30%">Approach<br />
            Node</th>
          <th scope="col" width="30%">Edge</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Hover</th>
          <td>Shows title; author bio in <em>Comments</em></td>
          <td>Shows title; brief explanation in <em>Comments</em></td>
          <td>Shows title; brief explanation in <em>Comments</em></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Click</th>
          <td>Post shows in this window; bio remains until mouse hovers elsewhere in graph</td>
          <td>Long explanation shows in this window; bio remains until mouse hovers elsewhere in graph</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Hovering the mouse over a post node shows its title and the author's photo and bio in the <em>Comments</em> area below the graph to the right. Clicking brings up the post in this window, and makes the bio stay until the mouse hovers elsewhere in the graph. <em>This functionality is the same in all four views</em>.</li>
  <li>Hovering above an approach node shows an explanation the <em>Comments</em> area; clicking will keep it there until the mouse hovers elsewhere in the graph.</li>
  <li> Hovering over edges shows a brief explanation of why the linked post is associated with that approach (either due to the author's home discipline, or because it appears in the post).</li>
  <li>By default the Comments section explains the color scheme for the post nodes. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Themes View</strong>. This shows nodes for the posts and also for the four themes explored in the posts. Hovering the mouse above the theme nodes shows an explanation in the <em>Comments</em> area below the graph to the right.</p>
