<p>The goal of this site is to help you choose a path through our posts. This page explains <strong>features of the posts</strong> themselves; the other pages provide an overview of how the site works, and suggest ways to choose which post to start with and which ones to read after that.</p>

<h3><a name="Posts">A Note About the Posts</a></h3>
<p>The posts appear here substantially as they did on the original blog.</p>
<ul>

  <tr><td width="10%"><img src="icons/reflection.jpg" width="30" height="16" alt=""/></td><td><strong>"Reflection Post"--a statement of the author's own views</strong> on our topic, in response to other posts.</td></tr>

  </ul>
  <li><strong>Comments</strong>. We reproduced any comments a post received on the blog <strong>at the end of post as it appears here</strong>. We do not treat comments as separate posts, with their own nodes. </li>

  <ul>
    <li>Links to <strong>external websites</strong> bring up a <strong>new browser window</strong>.</li>
    <li>Links to <strong>posts in the blog that were not part of the series</strong> of posts for this project bring up a <strong>new browser window</strong>.</li>
    <li>Links to <strong>posts in this series</strong> show the post in this window.</li>
