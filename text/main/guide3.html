<p>The goal of this guide is to help you choose a path through our posts. This page explains <strong>features of the posts</strong> themselves; the other pages provide an overview of how the site works, and suggest ways to choose which post to start with and which ones to read after that.</p>

<h3><a name="Posts">A Note About the Posts</a></h3>
<p>The posts appear here substantially as they did on the original blog.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Legend</strong>. After the main text of each post (but before any comments) is a legend that summarizes the characteristics used to connect the post in the graphs. (As discussed in the <a href="pairings/auto-pairings.html">Explanation of Emergent Pairings</a> page, the legend can be said to show the post's metadata.) The legend contains (up to) six icons:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>The icon that represents the post in the graphs.</li>
  <li>An icon indicating the post type:</li>
  <table width="85%"><tbody>
  <tr><td width="10%"><img src="icons/reading.jpg" width="50" height="24" title="image from http://www.freeclipartnow.com" alt=""/></td><td><strong>"Reading Post"--a discussion of a particular reading</strong> from the author's home discipline; includes citation information for (and links to) the reading.</td></tr>
  <tr><td width="10%"><img src="icons/reflection.jpg" width="50" height="24" title ="image from von Klaus-Dieter Keller (Eigenes Werk) [CC BY 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" alt=""/></td><td><strong>"Reflection Post"--a statement of the author's own views</strong> on our topic, often in response to other posts.</td></tr>
  </tbody></table>
  <li>The icon for the approach associated with the author's home discipline (see explanations available from the Content tab in the main menu at the top of the screen).</li>
  <li>The icon for the additional approach (if any) found in the post.</li>
  <li>The icon for a theme addressed in the post, and the outlook taken on it (see explanations available from the Content tab in the main menu at the top of the screen).</li>
  <li>The icon for a second theme addressed in the post (if present), and the outlook taken on it.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Comments</strong>. We reproduced any comments a post received on the blog <strong>at the end of post as it appears on this site</strong>. We do not treat comments as separate posts, with their own nodes. </li>
  <li><strong>Links</strong>.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Links to <strong>external websites</strong> bring up a <strong>new browser window</strong>.</li>
    <li>Links to <strong>posts in the blog that were not part of the series</strong> of posts for this project bring up a <strong>new browser window</strong>.</li>
    <li>Links to <strong>posts in this series</strong> show the post in this space. <strong>To return to referring post click its node</strong> (highlighted with green border) in the graph--NOTE: depending on your browser, clicking the &quot;back&quot;` button may reset the whole screen.</li>
  </ul>
