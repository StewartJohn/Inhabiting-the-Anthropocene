<p>The graph now highlights posts that take the "Descriptive Approach"--represented by the brown  square labeled "D."</p>
<table width="85%" border="0" cellpadding="3">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="38"><img src="../../legends/images/D-node.jpg" width="34" height="32" alt=""/></td>
      <td>Descriptive: focuses on the material basis for habitation in terms of physical and biological processes, and how these processes are found across species</td>
    </tr>

<p>We treat the Descriptive Approach as characteristic of the natural sciences. On the basis of their home disciplines, we associate it with the following authors (assigned colors based on its color) and their posts, which are linked to the Descriptive node by a <em>solid</em> line.</p>

<p>In addition to these posts, several others by authors who are not based in the natural sciences display the Descriptive Approach. These have colors outside the family used for the Descriptive Approach, and are linked to that node by <em>broken</em> lines.</p>
