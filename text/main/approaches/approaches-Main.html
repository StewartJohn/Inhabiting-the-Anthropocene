<p>This graph represents the intellectual approaches taken in our posts. It reflects the backgrounds found in our team, given its particular membership; see the list below. This list is by no means exhaustive, and there are obvious overlaps among the approaches. </p>
<p>Each post is categorized by two approaches—one reflecting the discipline of its author, the other an additional approach it engages.</p>
<div>Each post is categorized by two approaches—one reflecting the discipline of its author, the other an additional approach it engages.
  <ul>
    <li>In the graph each approach is represented by a square, and each has a different color (see the explanation below, which will also appear below the graph, to the left, when relevant).</li>
    <li>Each author is associated with an approach on the basis of his or her disciplinary affiliation (see below), and has been assigned a color derived from the color for that approach.
      <ul>
        <li>In all views the nodes representing a given author's posts have the respective color.</li>
        <li>In this view the author's posts are linked to the node for that approach by a <em>solid</em> line.</li>
        <li>Most posts also reflect a second approach, not based on the author's home discipline. In this view this is indicated by a <em>broken</em> line to the node for the second approach.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We hope that the range of color in the graphs conveys the richly interdisciplinary character of our project.</li>
