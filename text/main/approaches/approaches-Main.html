<div align="center" style="font-size:24px">Approaches to Habitation in the Anthropocene</div>

<p>This list is neither exhaustive nor disjunctive; it represents the approaches taken by our team given its particular membership, and there are obvious overlaps among them. Each post is categorized by two approachesâ€”one reflecting the discipline of the author, the other an additional approach it engages.</p>
<p>In the "Approaches" view of the graph each approach is represented by a [shape], and each has a different color--see the legend below the graph. Each author is associated with an approach on the basis of his or her disciplinary affliliation (see below), and has been assigned a color related to the color for that approach. The nodes representing a given author's posts have thre respective color--that color is used in all views (see the legend). We hope that the range of color in the graphs conveys the richly interdisciplinary quality of our project.</p>

<blockquote>Descriptive: focuses on the material basis for habitation in terms of physical and biological processes, and how these processes are found across species; characteristic of the natural sciences--on our team, Biology (Antonio Martinez Castro, Kiza Gates, Ingo Schlupp) and Geology Lynn Soreghan)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Interpretive: focuses on human habitation as a social and cultural phenomenon, and how human habitation practices are invested with meaning; characteristic of the social sciences--on our team, Anthropology (Noah Theriault) and Archeology (Asa Randall)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Normative: focuses on the justification or evaluation of human habitation practices in moral terms, and the moral values that those practices can be interpreted to express; characteristic of the humanities--on our team, Philosophy (Zev Trachtenberg)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Practical: focuses on the implementation of habitation practices and infrastructure through the creation of the built environment; characteristic of applied disciplines--on our team, City Planning (Meghan Wieters)</blockquote>
