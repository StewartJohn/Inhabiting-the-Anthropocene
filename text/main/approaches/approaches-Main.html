<p align="center" style="font-size:24px">Approaches to Habitation in the Anthropocene</p>
<p>This list is neither exhaustive nor disjunctive; it represents the approaches taken by our team given its particular membership, and there are obvious overlaps among them. </p>
<div>Each post is categorized by two approachesâ€”one reflecting the discipline of its author, the other an additional approach it engages.
  <ul>
    <li>In the "Approaches" view of the graph each approach is represented by a square, and each has a different color (see the explanation below, and also below the graph, to the left).</li>
    <li>Each author is associated with an approach on the basis of his or her disciplinary affliliation (see below), and has been assigned a color derived from the color for that approach (see the explanation below the graph, to the right).
      <ul>
        <li>The nodes representing a given author's posts have the respective color--that color is used in all views.</li>
        <li>The author's posts are linked to the node for that approach by a solid line.</li>
        <li>Most posts also reflect a second approach, not based on the author's home discipline. This is indicated by a broken line to the node for the second approach.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We hope that the range of color in the graphs conveys the richly interdisciplinary quality of our project.</li>
  </ul>
