<div align="center" style="font-size:24px">Approaches to Habitation in the Anthropocene</div>

<p>This list is neither exhaustive nor disjunctive; it represents the approaches taken by our team given its particular membership, and there are obvious overlaps among them. Each post is categorized by two approachesâ€”one reflecting the discipline of the author, the other an additional approach it engages.</p>
<p>In the "Approaches" view of the graph each approach is represented by a [shape], and each has a different color--see the legend below the graph. Each author is associated with an approach on the basis of his or her disciplinary affliliation (see below), and has been assigned a color related to the color for that approach. The nodes representing a given author's posts have thre respective color--that color is used in all views (see the legend). We hope that the range of color in the graphs conveys the richly interdisciplinary quality of our project.</p>
<blockquote>Interpretive: focuses on human habitation as a social and cultural phenomenon, and how human habitation practices are invested with meaning; characteristic of the social sciences--on our team, Anthropology (Noah Theriault) and Archeology (Asa Randall)</blockquote>
