<p align="center" style="font-size:24px">Chronological Ordering of Posts</p>

<p>This site collects <a href="http://inhabitingtheanthropocene.com/category/social-media-in-the-anthropocene/" target="_blank">sixteen posts originally written for the blog Inhabiting the Anthropocene</a>, as part of the Social Media in the Anthropocene project.</p>
<p>Posts were written two per week over a period of eight weeks during February - April, 2015. They appeared in two rounds. The first round consisted of &quot;reading posts,&quot; in which the author used a reading from his or her home discipline to help frame the question of habitation in the Anthropocene (in the graph, the labels for these nodes end in &quot;1&quot;). In the second round the authors offered their own reflections on the topic, informed by what they had said in their reading posts, and also in response to other posts in the series (the labels for these nodes end in &quot;2&quot;).</p>
<p>Other views (click &quot;Select a View&quot; below the graph to the right) reveal the conceptual relationships within the collection of posts--related to the approaches taken by the authors, or the themes the authors explore--in a synchronic way. But they do not provide an evident sequence from one post to the next--and indeed the temporal order of posts was entirely arbitrary. Nonetheless,  this graph offers a diachronic path through the collection, representing  the posts' temporal sequence alone. </p>
<p>(Authors and titles appear in order below--the colors of the authors names reflect their home disciplines--see the <a href="approaches/approaches-Main.html">Explanation of Approaches</a> page. Click on a node in the graph to read the post in this space.)</p>
