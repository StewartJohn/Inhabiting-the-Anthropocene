      <td><strong>Limits.</strong> The recognition that human beings are profoundly adept at altering their environment to make it more habitable reinforces a conception of ourselves as capable of transcending constraints to our way of life apparently imposed on us by nature. Does humanity indeed have the potential to escape natural limits? Or, are our modes of habitation subject to the kinds of limitations expressed by the proposal that there are “planetary boundaries”—parameters which determine the conditions under which the Earth system is habitable? Alternatively, whether or not technology makes habitation feasible outside those boundaries, are there moral limits to human habitation practices which demand consideration of whether all people—and other species—have fair access to habitability?</td>
