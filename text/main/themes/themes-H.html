<p>The graph now highlights posts that explore the theme of History--represented by the gray triangle labeled "H." Posts are sorted on the basis of their taking one of two views on this theme--indicated by the style of the line (solid or broken) linking it to the theme node.</p>

      <td><strong>History.</strong> The situation of inhabitants of the Anthropocene—that they live in a world shaped by human activity—is not new or unique: every generation of humans has inhabited a world that was already inhabited before them; the landscape they occupied had already been shaped to make it habitable by its prior inhabitants. In this sense, habitation has a history. But what is the character of that history? Does it follow an inner logic, whereby an inevitable increase in technological power enables indefinite improvement in human habitation? Or is the history of human habitation more contingent and complex, so that present forms reflect an accumulation of more-or-less diverse and arbitrary actions taken in the past?</td>
