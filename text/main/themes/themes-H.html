<div align="center" style="font-size:24px">Themes that Emerged in Our Posts</div>

<p>The members of our team shared a very general understanding of habitability as a recursive process, by which a landscape is made habitable by the efforts of its inhabitants, who transform it in order to attain that goal—but where those transformations may in fact compromise its habitability; that is the manifest challenge of the Anthropocene.</p>

<p>However, the authors brought more particularized interests to the project as well, leading them to raise other issues and explore other questions. Once all the posts were written the authors met to reflect on the series as a whole, and to discuss additional concerns that had emerged. The themes listed below seemed most significant. Not all of them came up in every post posts—but each came up frequently enough that we can speak of posts clustering around several emergent themes. Some authors held similar views on some themes; there were also revealing divergences. The following list indicates some of the structure of the conceptual terrain the authors explored with their posts, so to speak. The posts can be interpreted as sights seen on pathways flagged by the questions that articulate each theme.</p>

<p>Following each description are brief explanations we used to sort posts on that theme into two broad groups. Posts in a group are by no means in complete agreement--but they share a similar kind of emphasis. We do not mean to suggest a strict categorization with these labels. Rather, their ultimate function is to help us articulate ways that two posts can bee seen as similar or different. For convenience we label the two views (indicated by italics)--though the labels are meant to be suggestive, not precise.</p>

<blockquote><strong>History.</strong> The situation of inhabitants of the Anthropocene—that they live in a world shaped by human activity—is not new or unique: every generation of humans has inhabited a world that was already inhabited before them; the landscape they occupied had already been shaped to make it habitable by its prior inhabitants. In this sense, habitation has a history. But what is the character of that history? Does it follow an inner logic, whereby the inevitable increase in technological power enables indefinite improvement in human habitation? Or is the history of human habitation more contingent, so that present forms reflect an accumulation of more-or-less arbitrary actions taken in the past?

<blockquote><em>Labels for alternative views</em>: Emphasis on <em>complexity</em> of factors shaping a habitat/emphasis on conceptual <em>reduction</em> of explanation of habitation to a core factor.</blockquote></blockquote>
