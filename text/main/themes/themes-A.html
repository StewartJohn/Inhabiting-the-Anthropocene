<div align="center" style="font-size:24px">Themes that Emerged in Our Posts</div>

<p>The members of our team shared a very general understanding of habitability as a recursive process, by which a landscape is made habitable by the efforts of its inhabitants, who transform it in order to attain that goal—but where those transformations may in fact compromise its habitability; that is the manifest challenge of the Anthropocene.</p>

<p>However, the authors brought more particularized interests to the project as well, leading them to raise other issues and explore other questions. Once all the posts were written the authors met to reflect on the series as a whole, and to discuss additional concerns that had emerged. The themes listed below seemed most significant. Not all of them came up in every post posts—but each came up frequently enough that we can speak of posts clustering around several emergent themes. Some authors held similar views on some themes; there were also revealing divergences. The following list indicates some of the structure of the conceptual terrain the authors explored with their posts, so to speak. The posts can be interpreted as sights seen on pathways flagged by the questions that articulate each theme.</p>

<p>Following each description are brief explanations we used to sort posts on that theme into two broad groups. Posts in a group are by no means in complete agreement--but they share a similar kind of emphasis. We do not mean to suggest a strict categorization with these labels. Rather, their ultimate function is to help us articulate ways that two posts can bee seen as similar or different. For convenience we label the two views (indicated by italics)--though the labels are meant to be suggestive, not precise.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Agency.</strong> The Anthropocene proposal seems to accept as a basis for any further thinking the claim that human activity is the decisive factor shaping Earth’s habitability—for humans and all other forms of life. But is this attribution of agency to humanity correct? Does it indeed convey the reality of the situation with Earth system processes? Or does it overstate human power and understate the influence of non-human factors in shaping the environment—and perhaps, in so doing, flatter humans’ sense of preeminence and discount the moral status of other species. And, as must be asked, who is the “anthropos” of the Anthropocene? Is the agency responsible for the putative new era held by undifferentiated humanity as a whole? Or ought it to be attributed to specific groups in specific societies, in view of the impacts of their specific habitation practices?
