      <td><strong>Agency.</strong> The Anthropocene proposal seems to accept as a basis for any further thinking the claim that human activity is the decisive factor shaping Earth’s habitability—for humans and all other forms of life. But is this attribution of overwhelming influence to humanity correct? Does it indeed convey the reality of the situation with Earth system processes? Or does it overstate human power and understate the workings of non-human factors in shaping the environment—and perhaps, in so doing, at once flatter humans’ sense of preeminence and discount the moral status of other species? And, as must be asked, who is the “anthropos” of the Anthropocene? Is the agency responsible for the putative new era held by undifferentiated humanity as a whole? Or ought it to be attributed to specific groups in specific societies, in view of the impacts of their specific habitation practices?</td>
