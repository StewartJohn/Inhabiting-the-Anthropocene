<p>Unlike a conventional article, and even more than many blogs, this site poses the challenge of sequence: what to read first, and what to read next. We offer that challenge in the spirit of an invitation: we imagine our readers as, in effect, co-authors--in the sense that the order in which they read the posts in our series is entirely up to them. Nontheless, we have attempted to provide some "navigational guidance" which we hope will help readers choose a path through the space of posts that rewards their own interests.</p></p>
