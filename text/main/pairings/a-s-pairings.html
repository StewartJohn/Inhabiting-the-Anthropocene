<p align="center" style="font-size:24px">Author-Supplied Pairings Between Posts</p>
<p>This graph represents relationships the authors see between their posts and others in this project. It reflects  a kind of aggregated authorship--not the joint authorship of a single argument, but rather a representation of  some of the similarities and differences the authors see within the full set of posts.</p>
<p>A goal for this graph is to provide advice to the reader on how to navigate through the collection. It is meant to be a tool for conveying the authors' suggestions about how to read particular posts together--in specific sequences or simply in conjunction with each other. We hope that it helps readers identify pathways along which posts build on each other's meaning. In particular, for each post the graph suggests another that reinforces it, as well as one that provides a contrasting outlook (see instructions below).  </p>

<p>We developed the graph as follows. After all the posts were written the authors met to identify themes that emerged across the series--see the Themes View. Keeping in mind those themes, the views taken on them, and also the approaches taken in the various posts (see the Approaches View), the authors then provided suggestions for posts to read alongside their own. For each of their posts they identified one they saw as broadly similar, and one they saw as broadly different--where the similarities and differences could be articulated in terms of the approaches and themes found across the set.</p>

<p>The graph thus expresses the authors' reflections on the relationships they discerned among the posts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Links between nodes show where an author sees a relationship between the respective posts.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The color of the link indicates which author suggested it (it is the same color as that author's node).    </li>
    <li>The style of the link indicates the relationship between the posts
      <ul>
        <li>If the link has an arrow,  the author suggested the posts be read in sequence.</li>
        <li>If the link is a broken line,  the author sees the two posts as broadly similar.</li>
        <li>If the link is a faint line,  the author sees the two posts as broadly different.</li>
        <li>Posts by the same author are linked by an solid line, with an arrow running from his or her first to second post.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <!--li>Each type of link can be turned off and on using the buttons to the right of the graph--green indicates that type is visible, red that it is not visible.</li-->
  <li>Hover above a link to read (in the <em>Comments</em> below the graph) the author's brief explanation of the relationship he or she sees between the two posts--expressed in terms of the approaches and themes found across the posts.</li>
</ul>
<!--p>An alphabetical list of authors and post titles appear below--the colors of the authors names reflect their home disciplines--see the <em>Comments</em> below the graph, and the Approaches View. Click on a node to read the post in this space; the graph will highlight all the posts linked to it, suggested by other authors as well as its own.</p>
