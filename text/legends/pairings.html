<p style="font-style:italic">Explanation of elements in Author-Supplied Pairings View</p>
This graph presents suggestions the authors made about ways their posts can be paired with others. 
<li>For each of their own posts authors suggested one that was broadly similar and one that was broadly different.</li>
<li>The graph also links each author's own two posts.</li>
<li>Links can be toggled on and off using buttons to the right of the graph.</li>
<hr>
Circles represent posts:
<li>Color is based on author's discipline--see Approaches View [and Key (below graph).</li> 
<li>Initials indicate author:</li>
<li style="text-indent:15px">1 = reading post, 2 = reflection post</li>
<li style="text-indent:15px">see Contents page for details</li>
<li>Hover on circle to see title of post</li>
<li>Click on circle to:
<li style="text-indent:15px">Read post (to right of graph)</li>
<li style="text-indent:15px">[See author's bio (below graph)]</li>
<li style="text-indent:15px">Have graph show relationships the post's author sees to other posts</li> 

<hr>
Edges link posts identified by authors as similar or different (or by same author):
<li>Color of line indicates author who suggested it</li>
<li>Style of line indicates suggested relation between post<li>
<li style="text-indent:15px">Line between posts by same author is solid, in that author's color</li>
<li>Broken line between posts indicates author sees as similar</li>
<li style="text-indent:15px">Hover on a line to see explanation (below graph) </li>
