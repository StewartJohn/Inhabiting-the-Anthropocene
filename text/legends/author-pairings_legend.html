<p><strong>This graph represents suggestions the authors made about ways their posts can be paired with others--as broadly similar or broadly different.</strong></p>
<hr>
<strong>Circles represent posts:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Color is based on author's discipline--see the <a href="../main/approaches/approaches-Main.html" target="content">Explanation of Approaches</a> page</li>
  <li>Initials indicate author:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1 = reading post, 2 = reflection post</li>
    <li>see <a href="../main/contents.html" target="content">List of Posts</a> for details</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<strong>Edges link posts identified by authors as similar or different (or posts by the same author):</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Arrow indicates any suggestion of which post to read first</li>
  <li>Color of line indicates author who suggested it</li>
  <li>Style of line indicates suggested relation between post
    <ul>
      <li>Solid line = posts by same author (in that author's color)</li>
      <li>Broken line = author suggesting link sees the posts as similar</li>
      <li>Faint line = author suggesting link sees the posts as different</li>
      <li>Hover on an edge to see explanation (in <em>Comments</em> below graph to right) </li>
